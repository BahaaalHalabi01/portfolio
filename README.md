# Portfolio

This website was made to be a place where i can put a `prettier` version of my CV, demonstrating
my web development skills, and hopefully i can turn it into a nice showcase of all my previous/future projects. 

It is developed using Svelte5 **at time of making this Svelte5 still isn't production ready**. To make translations 
work as intended, i just used native svelte stores.


## create-sveltv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.
